BarCampNola 9 Website Repo

Tech Stack:

This site is generated with Jekyll (www.jekyllrb.com), and you'll need that installed to work on it.
Jekyll has a Ruby dependency. 

Windows: using either a Linux VM or Cloud9 IDE is going to be your
best bet. Ruby on Windows is the devil.

Mac - install Ruby however you heathens do it.

Ubuntu - 
    
    sudo apt-get install ruby
    sudo apt-get install gem
    gem install jekyll

Cloud9:
    
    gem install jekyll
