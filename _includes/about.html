  <p class="about-text">
    BarCampNola is New Orleans' premier community driven, self organizing, free, tech conference. Barcamp New Orleans, BarcampNola, Bearcamp. It goes by many names, and illicits a diverse range of emotions for participants every year. This means that you, BarCampNola attendees, get to decide and give the talks/presentations at the conference.
  </p>
  <p class="about-text">
    BarCampNola is made possible not only by our generous sponsors and organizers, but also by you - BarCampNola's attendees. While it's a tech-focused event, anything goes. Heck, "How to make the perfect sandwich" is a deliciously acceptable talk, especially if you've got a hands-on demo of the latest sandwich technology.

  <p class="about-text">
    The speaker line-up is generated by you and the other attendees who have a topic, story, knowledge, or experience to share with the rest of the community.
